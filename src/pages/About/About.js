                Hi, I'm Ujjwal Singhal, a Computer Science and Engineering student at ABES Engineering College. 
                <hr />
                I'm proficient in Python3, C++, C, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and have hands-on experience in frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. I also have strong fundamentals in Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Database Query Language (MySQL), and Object-Oriented Programming.
                <hr />
                I consider myself an optimistic and perfectionist person, always aiming to find the best in every challenge and refining my work until it's perfect. I sometimes tend to overthink, but I manage it by prioritizing tasks and taking practical steps, which keeps me balanced and productive.
                I believe in teamwork, problem-solving, and continually learning new technologies. Check out my work on GitHub and letâ€™s connect!

                Thanks for watching!
